    "Last session, we looked at linear regression, and learned about least-squares estimation. This topic is extended into *model fitting* for the current session. We will be thinking about scientific hypotheses as *models*, which are precise descriptions of relationships between variables. For example, according to Newton's second law of motion, the relationship between an object's force, mass, and acceleration is given by the equation $F = ma$\n",

Although they might be useful for describing phenomena, it can be argued that they lack predictive power.

    "## Fitting a non-linear model with one free parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example today is in the field of short-term memory. Storing visual information in short-term memory requires that stimuli in the environment are processed into an internal representation, and that this representation is maintained temporarily (typically for up to a few seconds). In the past, researchers have wondered whether human's faced storage capacity limits for visual information. In addition, they wondered whether there are limitations on the processing capacity. In other words, researchers wanted to know whether there was a maximum limit on the amount of information a person can have in short-term memory, and whether there is a maximum bandwith available for encoding information into short-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "One experiment used in the 1980s and 1990s is the *whole report* paradigm. In this type of experiment, participants are presented with a number of visual stimuli. For example, they could be presented with 8 different letters. The researcher would control how long the letters were visible before they were masked (replaced by a neutral stimulus). In this way, the researcher could control exactly how long participants could process the presented stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is measured in whole report experiments is how many of the stimuli participants could remember. At lower exposure durations, one would expect fewer stimuli to be processed, especially if humans have a limited processing capacity. In addition, if human short-term memory is of a limited storage capacity, one expects that subjects would struggle to recall all stimuli even under very long exposure durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, one would expect that the number of recalled stimuli rises as a function of the exposure duration (the slope determined by processing capacity), but that this rise is limited by an asymptote (storage capacity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the things we just said a bit more precisely. If the processing capacity (let's call it $C$) is limited, it should be divided among the number of stimuli that a participant is trying to recall (let's call that number $T$). So our capacity per stimulus is:\n",
    "\n",
    "${{C} \\over {T}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find how much of a stimulus was encoded, we need to multiply the processing capacity by the time that a participant was processing a stimulus (let's call that $\\tau$):\n",
    "\n",
    "${{C \\tau} \\over {T}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be used to describe the *probability of a stimulus finishing processing* (let's call that $s$). The following equation does just that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$s = 1 - \\exp{({{-C \\tau} \\over {T}})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, if there was no limit on processing capacity, we wouldn't have to divide the total capacity by the number of stimuli. Which would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$s = 1 - \\exp{(-C \\tau)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's assume there were fewer stimuli than participants could remember. In that case, the storage capacity wouldn't matter. The number of recalled stimuli (let's call it $E(score)$) could thus be computed by simply multiplying the probability that any one stimulus finishes encoding ($s$) by the number of stimuli ($T$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(score) = Ts$\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's recap: We have two models. In the first model, the limited processing capacity has to be divided over all stimuli. In the second model, the processing capacity does not have to be divided at all. The equations for these two models look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(score)_{1} = T (1 - \\exp{({{-C \\tau} \\over {T}})})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(score)_{2} = T (1 - \\exp{(-C \\tau)})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we know $T$, as this is the number of stimuli in our experiment. We also know $\\tau$, as this is the time participants were given to encode the stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an experiment, participants were always shown 3 stimuli. These stimuli were letters that participants were asked to type in after a brief delay. In each trial, stimuli were presented with a different exposure duration (time between the onset of the stimuli and the onset of the mask). These exposure durations could be 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320 milliseconds.\n",
